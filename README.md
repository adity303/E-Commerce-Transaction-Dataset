eCommerce Transactions Analysis and Modeling
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling transactional data from an eCommerce platform to derive actionable business insights, build predictive models, and implement customer-centric strategies. It uses data science and machine learning techniques to address various business challenges like customer segmentation, lookalike modeling, and sales analysis.

Project Structure
The project is divided into the following key tasks:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Cleaning and preprocessing data from three provided files:
Customers.csv
Products.csv
Transactions.csv
Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
Business Insights derived:
Top-performing products and categories.
Revenue trends over time.
Regional sales distribution.
Customer purchasing behavior.
Signup trends and customer lifetime value.
2. Lookalike Model
Developed a model to find the top 3 similar customers for a given customer based on:
Customer profile (region, signup date).
Transactional behavior (total spent, products purchased, average price, etc.).
Used Cosine Similarity to calculate similarity scores.
Output: A file Lookalike.csv containing similar customers and their scores for the first 20 customers.
3. Customer Segmentation
Implemented clustering techniques to segment customers into groups based on transactional and profile data.
Steps:
Normalized key features (e.g., total spending, product variety).
Applied the K-Means Clustering algorithm.
Evaluated clustering performance using the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI).
Visualized clusters in a reduced dimensional space using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
Output: A file Customer_Clusters.csv with cluster assignments for each customer.
Key Concepts and Techniques Used
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handling missing values.
Merging datasets using unique identifiers.
Feature engineering (e.g., customer lifetime value, average purchase value).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trend analysis (e.g., revenue over time).
Correlation analysis.
Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Lookalike Modeling

Similarity measurement using Cosine Similarity.
Feature scaling with StandardScaler.
Customer Segmentation

Clustering using K-Means.
Optimal cluster selection based on Davies-Bouldin Index.
Dimensionality reduction with PCA.
Evaluation Metrics

Davies-Bouldin Index for clustering performance.
Similarity scores for lookalike modeling.
Deliverables
Code: Jupyter Notebooks/Python scripts for all tasks.
Reports:
Insights from EDA.
Clustering results, including metrics and visualizations.
Generated Files:
Lookalike.csv: Top 3 similar customers and their scores.
Customer_Clusters.csv: Cluster assignments for each customer.
